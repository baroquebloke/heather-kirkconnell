  Heather Kirkconnell grew up in a large Presbyterian (USA) congregation with 
  vibrant music and education programs. Through her participation in choirs, 
  handbell ensembles, and the Montreat Worship and Music Conference, she 
  realized early on that she was called to be a church musician.

  Her studies brought her to Oberlin, OH where she completed a B.A. in French 
  and a B.Mus. in Organ Performance, with a minor in Historical Performance. 
  During her time at the Oberlin College and Conservatory, Heather's spiritual 
  life was fed through her participation at Peace Community Church and the 
  campus group Ecumenical Christians of Oberlin. Both of these communities 
  offered her new ways to think about God, new music with which to praise God, 
  and many wonderful opportunities to serve. After completion of her 
  undergraduate degree, Heather moved to Paris, France to study with 
  Jean-Baptiste Robin at the Conservatoire à Rayonnement Régional de Versailles. 
  She had many opportunities to play concerts on historical instruments in 
  Paris and Versailles, including the Chapelle Royale in the Château de Versailles.

  Alongside Heather's keyboard studies, she has maintained active participation 
  in excellent choirs and bell choirs, and takes great joy in sharing music with 
  children. She is currently the Interim Director of Music for Grace Episcopal 
  Church in Newton, MA. She is excited to be in ministry partnership with a 
  congregation that has a history of excellent music and participation of all ages.
